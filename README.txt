Place your logo and product images here for the site to show correctly.

Required filenames (used by the template):
 - logo.png            -> main site logo
 - product1.jpg        -> product 1 image
 - product2.jpg        -> product 2 image
 - product3.jpg        -> product 3 image
 - product4.jpg        -> product 4 image
 - product5.jpg        -> product 5 image
 - product6.jpg        -> product 6 image

Tips:
 - Use square or 3:2 images (min 800x800 recommended) for best results.
 - If your files have different names, either rename them or edit `TheJhumkaLuxury.html` to point to your filenames.
 - After replacing images, open `TheJhumkaLuxury.html` in your browser to verify.

If you'd like, upload the actual image files (logo + product photos) and I will place them into the folder and fine-tune the layout and alt text.
